	abstract = {Applying model-driven engineering (MDE) in industrial-scale systems requires managing complex models which may be very large. These models must be persisted in a way that allows their manipulation by client applications without fully loading them. In this paper, we propose Morsa, a model repository that provides scalable manipulation of large models through load on demand and incremental store; model persistence is supported by a NoSQL database. We discuss some load on demand and incremental store algorithms as well as a database design. A prototype that integrates transparently with EMF is presented, and its evaluation demonstrates that it is capable of fully managing large models with a limited amount of memory. Moreover, a set of benchmarks has been executed, exhibiting better performance than the EMF XMI file-based persistence and the most widely used model repository, CDO.},

However, there is little empirical evidence of the acceptance of MDE in industry which is the subject of this paper. The goal of this empirical study was to investigate the state of the practice of applying MDE and factors considered as important for its adoption. The subjects were developers of four large companies participating in a research project. The collected data came from multiple sources and covered the results of tool evaluations, interviews, and a survey. Among the factors, we found perceived usefulness, ease of use and the maturity of the tools to be important determinants for the adoption of MDE. We also discuss challenges with adopting MDE and present suggestions on how to succeed with the adoption process.},

	doi = {10.1145/2487766.2487769},
	abstract = {If models consist of more and more objects, time and space required to process these models becomes an issue. To solve this we can employ different existing frameworks that use different model representations (e.g. trees in XMI or relational data with CDO). Based on the observation that these frameworks reach different performance measures for different operations and different model characteristics, we rise the question if and how different model representations can be combined to mitigate performance issues of individual representations.

In this paper, we analyze different techniques to represent references, which are one important aspect to process large models efficiently. We present the persistence framework EMF-Fragments, which combines the representation of references as source-object contained sets of target-objects (e.g. in XMI) within the representation as relations similar to those in relational databases (e.g. with CDO). We also present a performance evaluation for both representations and discuss the use of both representations in three applications: models for source-code repositories, scientific data, and geo-spatial data.},

	abstract = {Let xxx and yyy be two random variables with continuous cumulative distribution functions fff and ggg. A statistic UUU depending on the relative ranks of the xxx's and yyy's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g the probability of obtaining a given UUU in a sample of nx′snx′sn x's and my′smy′sm y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving nnn and mmm. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of UUU for samples up to n=m=8n=m=8n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m,nm,nm, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives f(x){\textgreater}g(x)f(x){\textgreater}g(x)f(x) {\textgreater} g(x) for every xxx.},

able to construct large models and domain-specific languages in a systematic manner, enabling teams of modellers to construct and refine large models in collaboration, advancing the state of the art in model querying and transformations tools so that they can cope with large models (of the scale of millions of model elements), and providing an infrastructure for efficient storage, indexing and retrieval of large models.

	abstract = {The MEASURE project aims to integrate metrics across all phases of the software development lifecycle into a single decision support platform. For the earlier phases, metrics can be derived from models. Industrial use of model-driven engineering produces large model repositories, and high-performance querying is key to keep their metrics up to date. This paper presents an integration between the MEASURE metrics platform and the Hawk model indexing tool. Hawk was improved in several ways, such as adding support for the new Modelio metamodelling framework, or allowing Hawk servers to be provisioned through configuration files rather than through its web services. MEASURE and Hawk were then combined successfully to extract metrics from Modelio models of various domains, and Hawk was able to index and efficiently answer queries about the 2GB collection of models used by Softeam to develop Modelio.},
