	Abstract = {Applying model-driven engineering (MDE) in industrial-scale systems requires managing complex models which may be very large. These models must be persisted in a way that allows their manipulation by client applications without fully loading them. In this paper, we propose Morsa, a model repository that provides scalable manipulation of large models through load on demand and incremental store; model persistence is supported by a NoSQL database. We discuss some load on demand and incremental store algorithms as well as a database design. A prototype that integrates transparently with EMF is presented, and its evaluation demonstrates that it is capable of fully managing large models with a limited amount of memory. Moreover, a set of benchmarks has been executed, exhibiting better performance than the EMF XMI file-based persistence and the most widely used model repository, CDO.},

	Abstract = {Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has been promoted for many years as a means for handling the complexity of software development by raising the abstraction level and automating labor-intensive and error-prone tasks. However, there is little empirical evidence of the acceptance of MDE in industry which is the subject of this paper. The goal of this empirical study was to investigate the state of the practice of applying MDE and factors considered as important for its adoption. The subjects were developers of four large companies participating in a research project. The collected data came from multiple sources and covered the results of tool evaluations, interviews, and a survey. Among the factors, we found perceived usefulness, ease of use and the maturity of the tools to be important determinants for the adoption of MDE. We also discuss challenges with adopting MDE and present suggestions on how to succeed with the adoption process.},

@inproceedings{scheidgen_reference_2013,
	Abstract = {If models consist of more and more objects, time and space required to process these models becomes an issue. To solve this we can employ different existing frameworks that use different model representations (e.g. trees in XMI or relational data with CDO). Based on the observation that these frameworks reach different performance measures for different operations and different model characteristics, we rise the question if and how different model representations can be combined to mitigate performance issues of individual representations.

In this paper, we analyze different techniques to represent references, which are one important aspect to process large models efficiently. We present the persistence framework EMF-Fragments, which combines the representation of references as source-object contained sets of target-objects (e.g. in XMI) within the representation as relations similar to those in relational databases (e.g. with CDO). We also present a performance evaluation for both representations and discuss the use of both representations in three applications: models for source-code repositories, scientific data, and geo-spatial data.},

@article{mann_test_1947,
	Abstract = {Let xxx and yyy be two random variables with continuous cumulative distribution functions fff and ggg. A statistic UUU depending on the relative ranks of the xxx's and yyy's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f=gf=gf = g the probability of obtaining a given UUU in a sample of nx‚Ä≤snx‚Ä≤sn x's and my‚Ä≤smy‚Ä≤sm y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving nnn and mmm. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of UUU for samples up to n=m=8n=m=8n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m,nm,nm, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives f(x){\textgreater}g(x)f(x){\textgreater}g(x)f(x) {\textgreater} g(x) for every xxx.},

	Abstract = {Recent research in scalable model-driven engineering now allows very large models to be stored and queried. Due to their size, rather than transferring such models over the network in their entirety, it is typically more efficient to access them remotely using networked services (e.g. model repositories, model indexes). Little attention has been paid so far to the nature of these services, and whether they remain responsive with an increasing number of concurrent clients. This paper extends a previous empirical study on the impact of certain key decisions on the scalability of concurrent model queries on two domains, using an Eclipse Connected Data Objects model repository, four configurations of the Hawk model index and a Neo4j-based configuration of the NeoEMF model store. The study evaluates the impact of the network protocol, the API design, the caching layer, the query language and the type of database and analyses the reasons for their varying levels of performance. The design of the API was shown to make a bigger difference compared to the network protocol (HTTP/TCP) used. Where available, the query-specific indexed and derived attributes in Hawk outperformed the comprehensive generic caching in CDO. Finally, the results illustrate the still ongoing evolution of graph databases: two tools using different versions of the same backend had very different performance, with one slower than CDO and the other faster than it.},
